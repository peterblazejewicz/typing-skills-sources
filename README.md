# Typing Skills: AI-Assisted Improvements

Based on public academic research papers, this is a collection of AI-generated workshops/etudes built by a custom-trained AI assistant (Google Gemini).

## How Does It Work?

- You provide academic papers on a topic; they must be freely available.
- You train assistant to help you improve your skillset.
- You create a request for, say, list of 100 words to improve LH <> RH muscle memory, while stil offering easy to feel 'rhythm', so it can be treated as a music exercsise

### Example Answer by the Custom Assistant

As a fellow enthusiast, I believe our practice should be as informed as it is passionate. My workout compositions are not random; they are grounded in scientific studies of motor skills, cognitive processing, and the biomechanics of typing.

Here are the core principles I draw from the research you provided, which guide the creation of your "etudes":

#### 1. The Principle of Hand Alternation

The most fundamental principle for achieving typing flow is maximizing the switch between the left and right hands. My lists are structured to force this alternation as much as possible.

- **Alternation is Faster:** Studies consistently show that the intervals between successive keystrokes are, on average, shorter when the hands alternate compared to when the same hand is used for consecutive keys. One analysis even quantifies this, finding that alternate-hand stroking is the dominant factor in speedâ€”being as much as 40 ms faster than same-hand stroking.
- **Creating Rhythm:** This rapid back-and-forth creates a sustainable and less fatiguing typing rhythm, which is the "flow" we are seeking. The QWERTY layout itself, by separating frequently used letter pairs, accidentally created a system that allows skilled typists to leverage this hand-alternation advantage.

#### 2. The Concept of Rhythm and "The Levelling Effect"

Expert typing is not just a series of fast, disjointed movements; it's a smooth, rhythmic performance. The workouts are designed to train this consistency.

- **Constant Rhythm:** Research has identified a "levelling effect," where a typist instinctively smooths out the time intervals between key pairs, working towards a constant rhythm. My lists encourage this by providing predictable patterns of alternating short and long words, allowing you to find and maintain a cadence.
- **Typing in Bursts:** Natural typing often proceeds in bursts of keystrokes rather than isolated ones. The phrases and patterns in the lists are designed to be typed as single, fluid bursts.

#### 3. The Role of Motor Skill and "Chunking"

Your request to add longer words was astute, as it directly challenges a key component of expert typing.

- **From Letters to Chunks:** Skilled typists do not process text letter by letter. Through practice, they "chunk" letters into larger units like syllables and words, which are retrieved and executed as a single motor program.
- **Challenging the Chunks:** Introducing longer words like `government` or `information` into a high-speed alternating pattern tests your ability to execute these longer "chunks" without breaking the overall rhythm. It's a more demanding cognitive and motor task, which is why you "feel the pain" in a satisfying way.

#### 4. Keyboard Layout and Finger Load

The design of the QWERTY keyboard is not symmetrical, which has implications for how we should train.

- **Asymmetrical Load:** The left hand is responsible for typing more letters (15) than the right hand (11) on the standard QWERTY layout. Furthermore, analysis shows that in typical English text, the left hand is overloaded and the upper row is used over 50% of the time.
- **Targeted Exercises:** This is why I include specific left-hand-only and right-hand-only passages in the etudes. They serve as targeted exercises to build strength, dexterity, and endurance in each hand independently, especially the more heavily burdened left hand.
